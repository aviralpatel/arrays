# C Arrays

C arrays are a way to store multiple values of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. To declare an array in C, you specify the data type of the elements and the number of elements in the array. You can initialize an array by enclosing the values of the elements in curly braces. You can access array elements using the square brackets and the index of the element. You can iterate over arrays using loops such as the for loop. Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays. Arrays are a fundamental data structure in C.

## Initialization

```
int arr[SIZE];
```

```
int arr[] = {1,5,2,7,9};
```

## Accsseing array elements

To access an element in an array, you use the square brackets [] and specify the index of the element you want to access. 

```
int x = arr[2];
```
